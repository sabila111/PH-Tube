        <h3>1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h3>
        <h5>Var:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Var declarations are globally scoped</li>
        <li>Var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope</li>
        <li>Hoisting occurs in var</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Let:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Let are block scoped</li>
        <li>Let variables can be updated but not re-declared</li>
        <li>Hoisting does not occur in let.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Const:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Const are block scoped</li>
        <li>Const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared</li>
        <li>Const maintains the constant values</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>
    <p>Null is an object in JavaScript and represents primitive data types. A null value in JavaScript is used for referring absence of any object value and if any function or variable returns null, then we can infer that the object could not be created. A null is neither an empty string (for character or datetime data types) nor a zero value (for numeric data types)</p>
    <p>An undefined variable in the source code of a computer program is a variable that is accessed in the code but has not been declared by that code. In some programming languages, an implicit declaration is provided the first time such a variable is encountered at compile time.The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.</p>

    <h3>3.What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
    <p>A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.</p>
